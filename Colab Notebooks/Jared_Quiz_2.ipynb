All of the problems below can be solved using only the NumPy functionality that does not require `for`-loops or list comprehension; the NumPy approach works much faster.\r\n","\r\n","1. Set the NumPy random seed to 12345 using the `np.random.seed()` function (don't forget to import the NumPy library first!).\r\n","2. Create a 1-dimensional NumPy array of 1,000,000 random *integers* uniformly distributed from -1,000 to 1,000 (both limits are inclusive). Save this array in a variable called `data`.\r\n","3. For the array you created in the previous step, print to the screen \r\n","  * the minimum value,\r\n","  * the maximum value,\r\n","  * the mean,\r\n","  * the standard deviation,\r\n","  * the median,\r\n","  * the shape of the array.\r\n","4. In a new code cell, select all negative elements of the array and save the result as a new NumPy array called `neg`. Print to the screen the largest element and the mean of this array.\r\n","5. In a new code cell, count the total number of elements in `data` that fall in the range $[-45, 389]$ (note that both limits are inclusive).\r\n","6. Start a new code cell. You will need to verify the famous trigonometric identity for the sine of a double angle:\r\n","$$\r\n","\\sin (2\\phi ) = 2 \\sin\\phi\\cos\\phi\\;.\r\n","$$\r\n","  To do that, treat the elements of the `data` array as angles in radian (don't perform any angle conversion!). Then compute both the right-hand side and the left-hand side of the identity using your knowledge of NumPy universal functions and save the results as `rhs` and `lhs`, respectively. Now, compute the absolute value of the difference between `rhs` and `lhs` and save the result as `diff`. Finally, use your knowledge of NumPy boolean arrays and aggregating functions to demonstrate that `diff` does not contain any elements larger than `1e-15` (you are not allowed to print the whole `diff` array to the screen!).
